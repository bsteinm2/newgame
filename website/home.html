		<h2>Vim is amazing!</h2>
		<p>This website was made in the node.js framework, hosted freely by Heroku, and counts as my very first experience in learning vim, javascript, html, node, and more! I am devising a more appropriate server currently for a few html pages and a dynamic app to show video or something, but until then this is what I've got!</p>
